Harini S Mechatronics Student at Chennai Institute of Technology Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a passionate Mechatronics student with a strong foundation in mechanical engineering, electronics, and computer programming. My academic journey began at Sri Chaitanya School, where I developed a keen interest in robotics and automation. Currently, I’m honing my skills in mechatronics at the Chennai Institute of Technology, where I engage in hands-on projects that bridge theory with practical applications. I enjoy collaborating on innovative projects, contributing to open-source, and exploring the latest technologies in the field.
